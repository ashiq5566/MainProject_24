\chapter*{Abstract}
% No header and footer for this page
\thispagestyle{empty}
The Internet is considered a major amenity in todayâ€™s world. However, not all people can use the internet as the user need to know what is written on the screen. This makes the internet a completely useless technology for visually impaired people. E-mails are the most dependable way of communication over the Internet for sending and receiving information. As nearly 285 million people worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired and it is necessary to provide internet facilities for them. Therefore this project develops a voice-based email system that will aid visually impaired people to use the services for communication. \newline \newline
The main purpose of this project is to guide visually challenged users. The proposed system focuses on providing basic functionalities like composing, reading, sending, and receiving emails along with voice-based assistants. As the input to the system does not use a keyboard or mouse, users can easily give input by speaking the message. Thus, the system proposed is entirely different from the existing ones. The user will be able to give commands to the system which the system will follow.\newline \newline
The existing mail services do not provide easy access to visually challenged people because there are no readout options to hear the mail that is received at their mail addresses. In this proposed system, the speech is read in a regional language (Malayalam) to avail understandability of blind people. This system is completely based on interactive voice response which will make it user-friendly and efficient to use. Here, we use Python language to implement speech-to-text and text-to-speech. \newline \newpage
This application can help in overcoming some of the drawbacks of the existing email systems. In this system, the use of the keyboard has been eliminated completely. The user only requires listening to the voice commands given by the system and responding accordingly in order to perform the desired operations. It aims to help visually impaired people to be a part of the growing digital India by using the internet and also to make the life of such people quite easily. The success of this project will also encourage developers to build something more useful for visually impaired or illiterate people, who also deserve an equal standard in society.

% Section 4 of Chapter 3
\section{Implementation}
The implementation of the proposed voice-based email system for visually impaired individuals involves several steps. Firstly, the system requires a microphone for the user to input voice commands. These voice commands are then processed through a speech-to-text system, which uses the Python programming language to convert the spoken words into text. The text is then used to execute various email functions such as sending, receiving, and composing emails. Once the email function is performed, the system uses a text-to-speech system to read the email content back to the user in their regional language of Malayalam. This provides better understanding and accessibility for visually impaired individuals.\newline \newline
In addition to the basic email functionalities, the system also includes voice-based assistants to guide the user through the email process. This includes step-by-step instructions on how to perform various functions such as composing an email or sending a reply. The system also provides an option to save and store email addresses and contacts for future use. This eliminates the need for the user to remember the email addresses or type them in each time they wish to send an email.\newline \newline
The use of the Malayalam language for the text-to-speech function makes the system more accessible and user-friendly for visually impaired individuals in Kerala, India. This is especially important as Malayalam is the official language of Kerala and is widely spoken by its residents. The implementation of this feature not only makes the system more accessible but also helps promote inclusivity and equal access to technology for visually impaired individuals in the region.

\chapter{Agile Methodology}

% Section 1 of Chapter 4
\section{Introduction}
Agile methodology is a popular approach to software development that is well-suited for the development of a voice-based email system for visually impaired people. Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering working software quickly and continuously improving it over time. It is based on the principles of collaboration, flexibility, and rapid feedback. Agile methodology is particularly useful for software development projects that involve a high level of complexity and uncertainty, such as the development of the voice-based email system.\newline \newline
The agile methodology consists of several key practices that are designed to promote collaboration, rapid feedback, and continuous improvement. The first key practice is iterative development, which involves breaking the development process into small, manageable pieces or iterations. Each iteration involves a short period of time, typically one to four weeks, during which the development team works to complete a specific set of tasks or deliverables. At the end of each iteration, the team reviews the work completed and adjusts the development plan as necessary.\newline \newline
The second key practice is continuous integration, which involves integrating the work of different developers into a single, unified code base on a regular basis. This helps to ensure that the code is always up-to-date and that any issues or conflicts are identified and resolved quickly. The third key practice is test-driven development, which involves writing automated tests for each new piece of code before it is integrated into the code base. This helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and that any defects are identified and corrected quickly.\newline \newline
In the case of the voice-based email system, the agile methodology can be particularly useful in ensuring that the system is developed quickly, efficiently, and in a manner that is responsive to the needs of visually impaired users. The iterative development approach can be used to break the development process into smaller, more manageable pieces, such as developing individual features or functions of the system. Continuous integration can be used to ensure that the code is always up-to-date and that any issues or conflicts are identified and resolved quickly. Test-driven development can be used to ensure that the system is of high quality and that any defects are identified and corrected quickly.

\section{User Story}

A user story is a concise, high-level description of a feature or functionality of a product that is written from the perspective of the user or customer. It is used to capture the user's needs, goals, and desired outcomes, rather than specifying the technical details of how the feature will be implemented. User stories are a key component of agile software development methodologies, which emphasize collaboration and responding to change over following a rigid plan.\newline \newline
User stories typically follow a simple format, such as "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]." The user story describes a specific feature or functionality that the user needs in order to achieve a particular goal or outcome. By focusing on the user's needs and goals, user stories help ensure that development efforts are aligned with the user's needs and that the resulting product is more likely to be useful and valuable.\newline \newline
User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes and can be easily prioritized and organized by the development team. They are used to drive the development process, helping to ensure that the team is building features and functionality that are aligned with the user's needs. As the product evolves and new requirements emerge, user stories can be added, updated, or removed, allowing the team to respond quickly and effectively to changing circumstances. Overall, user stories are an important tool for building better products that meet the needs and goals of the end users. The user story of the system is given in Table 4.1

\section{Product Backlog}
The product backlog is a prioritized list of requirements or features that need to be developed for a product. It is a key artifact in agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, and serves as the single source of truth for all the work that needs to be done on the product.\newline \newline
The product backlog is typically owned by the product owner, who is responsible for prioritizing the items on the backlog based on the needs and goals of the stakeholders. The items on the backlog are typically user stories, which describe the features or functionality of the product from the perspective of the user.\newline \newline
The product backlog is dynamic and evolves over time as new information becomes available or as the product evolves. Items can be added, removed, or reprioritized based on feedback from stakeholders, changes in the market or technology, or other factors. The development team uses the product backlog to plan and execute their work, pulling items from the top of the backlog into each sprint or development cycle. The product backlog of the system is given in Table 4.3

\section{Testing and Validation}
Testing and validation are essential parts of any software development process. In the case of the voice-based email system for visually challenged people, testing and validation are crucial to ensure that the system is working as intended and meeting the requirements of the end-users.The testing process should begin with unit testing, where each module of the system is tested independently to ensure that it performs its functions correctly. The next step is integration testing, where the different modules are combined and tested as a single system. This testing process helps to identify any issues that may arise when the modules interact with each other.\newline \newline
Once the integration testing is complete, the system should undergo system testing to ensure that it meets all the functional and non-functional requirements. This testing process should also include testing the system's accessibility features to ensure that visually challenged people can use the system without difficulty.\newline \newline

\section{Git}
Git is a version control system used to track and manage changes in software code. In the context of the voice-based email system for visually impaired individuals, Git can be used to manage the project's source code and track changes made during the development process.\newline \newline
When working on the project, developers can use Git to create a local repository on their machine to store the project's code. They can make changes to the code, and then use Git to stage and commit those changes. Each commit represents a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time.\newline \newline
Once the developers have made several changes and commits, they can push their changes to a remote repository hosted on a platform like GitHub. This allows other team members to access the latest code changes and collaborate on the project. With Git, it's easy to track the history of the project, identify changes made by different team members, and revert to previous versions if necessary.\newline \newline

\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the proposed project aims to develop a voice-based email system for visually impaired individuals to enhance their communication abilities. The project has been developed using the Python programming language, which incorporates text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities to create an interactive voice response system that eliminates the need for a keyboard or mouse input. This will allow visually challenged users to give voice commands to compose, read, send, and receive emails efficiently.\newline \newline
The project has been implemented following the agile methodology, which has allowed for continuous iterations and improvements to be made. The testing and validation process involved multiple rounds of user testing, where visually impaired individuals provided valuable feedback that was used to refine the system further. The system was also tested for its accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in handling voice commands.\newline \newline
The use of a regional language (Malayalam) in the system has made it easily understandable for the target audience. The integration of Git has enabled version control and has facilitated the development process of the project. The successful implementation of the project will provide visually impaired individuals with a tool that will enable them to communicate effectively over the internet, promoting the inclusion and empowerment of visually challenged individuals in a growing digital India.
